# Chipotle Opimizer
- Downloaded the Chipotle nutrition facts dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandonqilin/chipotle-usa-menu-nutrition-dataset).
- Utilized PulP's opimization functions to minimize the number of calories in an order based on a set of constraints
- Used NumPy to perform matrix multiplication and addition the calculate the nutrition facts for the optimized order.
- Built a Streamlit web app that allows the user to specify their macronutrient goals and enter items that want to be included or excluded from their order. The app, using the user's input, displays a pie chart with their macronutrient information, thier optimized order, and the full nutrition facts for their optimized order.
